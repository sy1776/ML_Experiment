1. DESCRIPTION
  Below is the code packages for this project.
  1) Python codes - there are 5 Python scripts and 1 constant definition file. Each scripts are described below in detail. Their job essentially is to import the data
     from the file and performs various algorithms and saves output to database.
     a. main.py - wrapper script to call and execute other scripts.
     b. analyze_data.py - performs the descriptive and exploratory analysis on the dataset.
     c. manipulate_data.py - cleans and transforms categorical values into numerical values that will be fed into ML models. 
     d. models.py - runs various ML algorithms.
     e. utils.py - loads the data directly from UCI respository. plots the result

2. INSTALLATION
  System Requirement: following libraries are needed for python codes: Panda, Numpy, seaborn, urllib, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost.
  The code was developed and tested with Python 3.7 or higher.
  a.  Clone the code
   

3. EXECUTION
  a. Run a wrapper script, "main.py" like this - "python main.py" on command line.
     or
     Run a wrapper script, "main.py" in Python editor like Pycharm.
     It will execute below scripts in following order:
      util.py
      analyze_data.py
      manipulate_data.py 
      models.py
